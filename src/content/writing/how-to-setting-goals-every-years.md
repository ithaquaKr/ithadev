## How to setting goals every years?

Hey everyone! As the year winds down and a new one peeks around the corner, there's one task that always used to give me a major headache: setting goals for the next 12 months. Sound familiar?

I've tried countless times, and honestly, I've rarely felt truly successful. But this year, I'm excited to share a new, 4-step approach that I'm confident will make a real difference. It's all about making the process less daunting and more effective. Let's dive in!

### Step 1: Time to Look Back (Reflecting)

Before we rush into planning the future, let's take a moment to appreciate the past. This step is all about reflection, and it's super important!

Grab a cup of your favorite beverage, find a quiet spot, and ask yourself some honest questions about the year that's ending:

-   Did I feel happy this year? What were the moments that truly brought me joy?
-   What were the absolute highlights of the year?
-   Did I achieve anything I'm proud of, big or small?
-   What challenges did I face, and what did I learn from them?
-   Is there anything I wish I had done differently?

This isn't about judgment; it's about understanding your journey and gathering insights that will inform your next steps.

### Step 2: Let's Get Those Goals Down! (Setting Goals)

Now that you've reflected, it's time to look forward! For this step, I'm inspired by a fantastic framework from none other than Warren Buffett, which you can read more about here: [https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus).

Here's how we'll break it down:

#### 1. Brainstorm Your Desires

First, just write down *everything* you'd love to accomplish in the next year. Don't hold back! Think big, think small, just get it all out.

**Pro Tip:** Remember to distinguish between a **goal** and a **task**. A goal is the desired outcome (e.g., "Run a marathon"), while a task is a step to get there (e.g., "Run 3 times a week"). If you need a refresher, check out [[How to distinction between a task, a habit and a goals?]].

How many goals should you have? It's totally up to you! Some people like 10, others 20, or even 30. The recommendation is often to aim for somewhere between 10-20 to give yourself enough options.

#### 2. Give Your Goals a Home (Categorize)

Once you have your list, it's time to organize them. Assign each goal to a category. This helps you see where your focus is and ensures you're not neglecting important areas of your life.

Common categories include:
-   Work/Career
-   Personal Growth/Self-Improvement
-   Health & Wellness
-   Relationships (Family, Friends, Partner)
-   Finances
-   Hobbies/Creativity

While some recommend sticking to no more than four categories to keep things simple, I personally find that six works best for me. Find what feels right for *you*!

#### 3. Choose Your Champions (Top Goals)

This is where the Warren Buffett framework really shines! He suggests focusing intensely on your top five goals and putting the rest on an "Avoid at all costs" list.

What does that mean? It means your top five goals get 100% of your attention. The others? You literally throw them in the trash (mentally, of course!). If you keep thinking about those "other" goals, you're diluting your focus from what truly matters.

For me, I like a 5:20 ratio. I might start with 20 goals, but I commit to focusing on only five. Before you pick your top goals, consider which categories they fall into. This helps ensure you're prioritizing across different areas of your life (e.g., one career goal, one health goal, etc.).

#### 4. Stay Flexible (Adjust Goals)

Life is constantly in motion, right? Things change, priorities shift, and sometimes, our initial plans just don't go the way we expected. And that's perfectly okay!

This step is all about being adaptable. Don't be afraid to revisit your goals throughout the year and make adjustments as needed. It's not about failing; it's about staying aligned with your evolving self and circumstances.

### Finally...

The best part about this process? It's not just for your big yearly goals! You can easily apply these same four steps to your weekly, monthly, or even quarterly planning. It's a versatile tool to keep you focused and moving forward, no matter the timeframe.

So, are you ready to tackle your goals with a fresh perspective this year? Give this method a try and let me know how it goes! Happy goal-setting!
